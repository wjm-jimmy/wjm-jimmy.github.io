Motivated by widespread dominance hierarchy, variations of group sizes, and feedback mechanisms in social species, we are devoted to exploring the scalable second-order consensus of hierarchical groups. More specifically, a hierarchical group consists of a collection of agents with double-integrator dynamics on a directed acyclic graph with additional reverse edges, which characterize feedback mechanisms across hierarchical layers. As the group size varies and the reverse edges appear, we investigate whether the absolute velocity protocol and the relative velocity protocol can preserve the system consensus property without tuning the control gains. It is rigorously proved that the absolute velocity protocol is able to achieve completely scalable second-order consensus but the relative velocity protocol cannot. This result theoretically reveals how the scalable coordination behavior in hierarchical groups is determined by local interaction rules. Moreover, we find a hierarchical structure in order to achieve scalable second-order consensus for networks of any size and with any number of reverse edges.
