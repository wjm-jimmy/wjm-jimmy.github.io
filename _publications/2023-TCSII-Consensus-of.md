This brief is concerned with consensus of hybrid behavior for graphical coordination games. We take into account a multi-agent system with two agent-unions that have various preferences. Interactions among agents in the multi-agent system are modelled as a hybrid graphical coordination game, in which three kinds of payoff matrices are designed. By using potential game theory, necessary and sufficient conditions are established for achieving consensus of the hybrid graphical coordination game. Finally, several numerical simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.
